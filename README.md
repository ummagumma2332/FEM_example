This is an application of the Finite Elements Method.
In this example I make use of quadrilateral finite elements in order to find the displacement field of a rectangular structural beam.
The size of the structure is reconfigurable as well as the density of the meshing, the loading conditions (magnitude and topology of the force field) 
and the boundary conditions.

This code is under constant development and I will shortly upload an extention for the implementation of a Monte Carlo simulation assuming the 
existance of a stochastic field which describes the behavior of the modulus of elasticity over the length of the beam. 
To generate the realizations of this stochastic field we are using the Karhunen-Loeve series expansion.

Feel free to run and experiment with the code or even better suggest improvements.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63021871/132966811-fd5f27b5-abd1-41df-9c39-f13c8858ba32.png)
